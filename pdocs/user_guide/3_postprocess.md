## Post-processing

The `landingai` library provides a set of common post-processing APIs to further transform your inference result data.

Some common use cases are:

- Get the predicted class count over the predictions of a set of images
- Get the predicted pixel area (coverage) over the predictions of a set of images

See the `landingai.postprocess` module for more details.
