This application measures the width and length of a crack on a concrete surface. To use
the application, you must first calibrate the camera by selecting an line on the image
and intering the actual distance of the line in inches. Once this is done, you can upload
an image with a crack and the crack will be segmented by a LandingLens model, and then
analyzed so the length and maximum width of the crack can be found.
