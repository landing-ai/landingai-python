# LandingLens Python SDK
The LandingLens Python SDK contains the LandingLens development library and examples that show how to integrate your app with LandingLens in a variety of scenarios. The examples cover different model types, image acquisition sources, and post-procesing techniques. 

We've provided some examples in Jupyter Notebooks to focus on ease of use, and some examples in Python apps to provide a more robust and complete experience.

## Install the Library

```bash
pip install landingai
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

This library needs to communicate with the LandingLens platform to perform certain functions. For example, the `Predictor` API calls the HTTP endpoint of your deployed model. To enable communication with LandingLens, you will need the following information:

1. The **Endpoint ID** of your deployed model in LandingLens. You can find this on the Deploy page in LandingLens.
2. The **API Key** for the LandingLens organization that has the model you want to deploy. To learn how to generate these credentials, go [here](https://support.landing.ai/docs/api-key-and-api-secret).

### Run Inference
Run inference using the endpoint you created in LandingLens:

1. Install the Python library.
2. Create a `Predictor` class with your Endpoint ID and API Key.
3. Load your image into a PIL Image (below the image is "image.png")
4. Call the `predict()` function with an Image.

```python
from PIL import Image
from landingai.predict import Predictor
# Enter your API Key and Secret
endpoint_id = "FILL_YOUR_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_ID"
api_key = "FILL_YOUR_API_KEY"
# Load your image
image = Image.open("image.png")
# Run inference
predictor = Predictor(endpoint_id, api_key=api_key)
predictions = predictor.predict(image)
```

See an end to end **working example** [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/landing-ai/landingai-python/blob/main/examples/webcam-collab-notebook/webcam-collab-notebook.ipynb).

### Visualize and Save Predictions
Visualize your inference results by overlaying the predictions on the input image and saving the updated image:

```python
from landingai.visualize import overlay_predictions
# continue the above example
predictions = predictor.predict(image)
image_with_preds = overlay_predictions(predictions, image)
image_with_preds.save("image.jpg")
```
### Create a Vision Pipeline

All the modules shown above and others can be chained together using the `landingai.pipeline` abstraction. At its core, a pipeline is a sequence of chained calls that operate on a `landingai.pipeline.Frame`.

The following example shows how the previous sections come together on a pipeline. For more details, go to the [*Vision Pipelines User Guide*](https://landing-ai.github.io/landingai-python/landingai.html#vision-pipelines) 
```python
from landingai.predict import Predictor
import landingai.pipeline as pl

cloud_sky_model = Predictor("FILL_YOUR_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_ID"
                            , api_key="FILL_YOUR_API_KEY") 
Camera = pl.image_source.NetworkedCamera(stream_url)
for frame in Camera:
    (
        frame.downsize(width=1024)
        .run_predict(predictor=cloud_sky_model)
        .overlay_predictions()
        .show_image()
        .save_image(filename_prefix="./capture")
    )    
```

## Run Examples Locally

All the examples in this repo can be run locally.

To give you some guidance, here's how you can run the [`rtsp-capture`](https://github.com/landing-ai/landingai-python/tree/main/examples/capture-service) example locally in a shell environment:

1. Clone the repo to local: `git clone https://github.com/landing-ai/landingai-python.git`
2. Install the library: `poetry install --with examples` (See the [poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for how to install `poetry`)
3. Activate the virtual environment: `poetry shell`
4. Run: `python landingai-python/examples/capture-service/run.py`
