## Post-processing

The `landingai` library provides a set of common post-processing APIs to further transform your inference result data.

Some common use cases are:

1. Get the predicted class count over the predictions of a set of images
2. Get the predicted pixel area, i.e. coverage, over the predictions of a set of images

See the `landingai.postprocess` module for more details.
